title: Guild Artisan Personas FAQ

How does the process of moving up a persona become initiated? [Issue #8](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/8)
: The process of moving from one persona to another should be initiated with the help of your mentor. In the absence of a mentor, the most senior artisan on your team or account can step in. During your Career Retro (facilitated by your Account DE and Account Artisan), one topic of conversation should be about your career progression. Using the persona definitions as guidelines, a career plan should be constructed and reviewed during every Career Retro. Currently, the expectation is to have Career Retros on a 6 month cadence.

Who will judge an artisan's behaviors? [Issue #8](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/8)
: Artisans will be treated to individual attention, much like the current new-hire interview process. An artisan's mentor and peer are responsible for giving frequent and honest feedback to help the artisan grow. Once the artisan has been identified, evaluations will be given by Master Craftsmen and Craftsmen, depending on availability and level of the artisan being evaluated.

How will the behaviors be judged (checked off) since some are subjective? [Issue #8](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/8)
: For behaviors that are subjective, pairing and in-person observation will take place.

Pillar should provide an opportunity for community participation (10% time?) [Issue #12](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/12)
: answer goes here

Are my promotion qualifications tied heavily to my participation in activities outside of work (community paricipation)? [Inferred, Issue #12](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/12)
: Depends on how you define 'heavily.' Will someone who participates in the community grow and mature in their profession at a faster rate? Experience says 'yes'. So, an artisan that participates in activities outside of their billable time will progress at a faster rate.

Are measures like the number of releases optional? Or explain how that works? [Issue #14](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/314)
: answer goes here

Similarly, are the number of projects an optional criteria? [Issue #14](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/14)
: answer goes here

What are marketable technologies? [Issue #15](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/15)
: Marketable technologies are technologies that we can build solutions around. In other words, clients are actively requesting them and / or we see them becoming hot in the near term.

Where can I find the Pillar Practice Documents [Issue #15](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/15)
: The Pillar Practice Documents are a work in progress.

How do we plan to evaluate new hires? [Issue #16](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/16)
: Using the same process we do today: kata, pairing, leadership interview.

Does everyone start at Apprentice? [Issue #16](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/16)
: No.

Does past experience (employers/clients/etc) pre-Pillar count for something? [Issue #16](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/16)
: Yes.

Related, do prior expereinces with deployments, clients, etc. count for something? [Issue #16](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/16)
: Yes.

If someone has satisfied all requirements other than number of clients does that count? [Issue #18](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/18)
: TBD.

Where is the Table of Contents? [Issue #20](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/20)

What is the purpose of Years of Experience? [Issue #21](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/21)
: The purpose of years of experience is to give an artisan a general idea of where they stand on their journey.

Are the years of experience cummulative across the career or just at Pillar? [Inferred, Issue #21](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/21)
: Depends on the quality of the years accrued. The same year repeated 10 times is not the same as 10 years of professional growth.

Do multiple projects at one client count the same or similarly to multiple clients? [Inferred, Issue #21](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/21)
: Depends on what has been learned through the projects.  Dealing with the same issues and the same personalities on multiple projects is not as valuable (toward career growth) as learning to deal with a variety of issues and personalities in different cultural and political environments.

What is the intent behind hard numbers like Years of Experience and Clients worked for? [Inferred, Issue #21](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/21)
: To provide artisans with a general baseline for where they stand within the company and in the larger software development community.  It also serves as a rough measure of the variety of different types of issues and personalities and the range of different cultural and political environments that an artisan has learned to deal with throughout their career.

How can mentoring be a requirement when it isn't formally recognized and supported by the organization? [Inferred, Issue #21](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/21)

: Loosely.

: This list is under construction at the moment.

What happens if people are not doing a few of the items on the list? [Issue #28](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/28)

Clarify the expecations listed with each persona as the 'thing you should be doing to go to the next level' v. 'to be at this level' [Issue #29](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/29)

: answer goes here

Issue #33 is marked as having a question but I'm not picking a specific question out, best guess is 'Should we count projects rather than clients?' [Issue #33](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/33)
: This is addressed in the answers to the questions for Issue #21 and Issue #14.

What does 'actively integrating engineering practices and value practices' mean? [Issue #34](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/34)
: The artisan should be able to understand both the technical and business value of doing a thing. They should be able to quantify (in $ to the client, if necessary) the value of the thing they are building and the approach they are suggesting. In short, every artisan should strive to bridge the gap between the technical and the business requirements.

What are the Value Practices? [Issue #34](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/34)
: answer goes here

Why are we experimenting with a new hierarchical strucutre? [Issue #35](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/35)

How do we make sure we have the proper ratio of the various artisan groups in order to staff a project? [Issue #35](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/35)
: answer goes here

[Issue #35 contains some statement about roles being dictated by client requirements, from this I infer the following question] How do these personnas relate to the roles played at the client location? [Issue #35](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/35)
: As a consultant, you will always be playing multiple roles at any given time.  You will be minimally playing one role for Pillar and another role for a client.  Sometimes they will overlap greatly.  Other times, they will be completely different.  And even other times, you might be playing more than one role for the client (e.g. both the product owner and the iteration manager).  It entirely depends on what the client needs.  However, you shouldn't ever be playing a role at a client that you aren't either already able to handle or ready to grow into.  The example in the issue was, "what if an apprentice was asked to play a master craftsman role at a client."  That should never happen.  The apprentice wouldn't be ready to play that role.  If it does happen, please escalate that immediately, because we want to ensure that our artisans are always placed in a role where they can grow and be successful, and we want to ensure that we have the appropriate people in the appropriate roles to enable success at our clients.
